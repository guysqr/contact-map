    <h2>Contact Map correlates your location with reported data</h2>
    <p>Contact Map is designed to allow you to correlate your locations at different times to reported cases by areas.</p>
    <h2>Contact Map doesn't store your private data</h2>
    <p>When you upload your Google Takeout Location data to Contact Map, we transform it for use on Contact Map, but we never store your data on our servers to keep any record of your data. Once you close your browser, you data is gone.</p>
