# Contact Map

## About
The goal of Contact Map is to provide two things:

1. An Open API for COVID-19 data for Australia that provides a standard way to get data by date with the best precision that has been made available by the various authorities. Included will be an API for also getting location information, eg centroids and polygons of the areas to which the data relates.
2. A way for users to compare their own locations over time with the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the same areas.

The first part will be delivered via an Open API providing access to the data that is being collected for use by this app.

The second will be delivered by allowing users to anonymously upload their own location data (or enter it manually), then displaying it on the map keyed by the times for which COVID-19 data is available. A "play" feature will allow the user to see the data change over time and how their locations appear in relation to those changes.
